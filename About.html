        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p class="centered-paragraph">
            Our journey began in early 2023 with a simple idea and a passion for great coffee.
            We started by crafting "Kaffin in a Bottle" in our home in Mamatid, Cabuyao, Laguna.
            This unique concept allowed us to share our love for coffee with friends and family,
            bottling up joy in each batch. Our home-based venture quickly grew, and we found ourselves
            pouring our hearts into each bottle, carefully blending flavors that resonated with the warmth
            and comfort we wanted to bring to our community.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="centered-paragraph">
            To share our passion beyond bottles, we began the Coffee Cart Event services.
            Our first customers were our supportive family members, who believed in our dream from the
            very beginning. Their unending encouragement fueled our ambition and gratitude, motivating
            us to perfect our craft. These events were more than just coffee services; they became
            opportunities to connect with people, share stories, and build relationships, all centered
            around our shared love for coffee.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="centered-paragraph">
            By early 2024, our dream took a significant leap forward with the opening of our first physical shop in 
            Banadero, Calamba, Laguna. Old Coast Cafe was born out of a desire to create a welcoming space where 
            people could enjoy quality coffee and meaningful conversations. As we look to the future, we are excited 
            to expand Old Coast Cafe to new locations in Cabuyao and across Laguna and Manila. Our goal is to create 
            a place where everyone feels at home, whether they're grabbing a quick coffee or spending a leisurely 
            afternoon. Our commitment to our mission—to bring happiness through a cup of coffee and to let coffee 
            connect us—remains at the heart of everything we do.

            We recognize our responsibility to the environment and are committed to sustainable practices. From using

            footprint.
